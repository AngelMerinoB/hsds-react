# Components

Below is a (working) list of components we need to build for Blue.

Note: Beacon (v2) requires every one of these.

* [x] Avatar
* [x] AvatarStack
* [x] Button `*`
* [x] Badge
* [x] Card
* [x] CardBlock
* [x] Heading
* [x] Icon
* [x] Image
* [x] Input
* [x] Label
* [x] Link
* [x] Loader (...)
* [x] Modal `**`
* [x] Overlay
* [ ] Popover `*` (Difficulty reduced, if leveraging Tooltip)
* [x] Portal `*`
* [x] Select
* [ ] Spinner
* [x] Text
* [ ] Tooltip `***`
* [ ] Video `***` (Difficult due to the variety of external video sources.)

`*` = These will be hard(er) to code. The more stars, the harder it is.
