# Workflow

Below is a list of items related to the bundling / development workflow for Blue.

### JS

* [ ] Figure out how to bundle/build the components for `import` use via npm
* [ ] Pick a testing library (Jest? Ava? Mocha? Tape? etcâ€¦)
* [ ] Start writing tests!


### CSS

* [ ] Figure out some why to bundle/inline/build the CSS into the React components. ([styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) maybe?)
