# Modal

A Modal component presents content within a container on top of the application's main UI. Modals can have multiple instances, in which case they will overlay on top of each other. This component supports [`react-router`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).


## Components

The Modal component is comprised of smaller components:

* [Modal](./docs/Modal.md)
* [Header](./docs/Header.md)
* [Body](./docs/Body.md)
* [Footer](./docs/Footer.md)
