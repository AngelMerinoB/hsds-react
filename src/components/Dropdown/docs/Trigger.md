# Trigger

A Trigger component is an enhanced [Button](../Button) component used specifically for [Dropdowns](./Dropdown.md).


## Example

```jsx
<Dropdown>
  <Dropdown.Trigger>Chooseâ€¦</Dropdown.Trigger>
</Dropdown>
```


### Custom Markup

By default, if a text-node is passed into Trigger, it will render the text-node into an enhanced [Button](../../Button) wrapper. However, you can provide you own component into Trigger as well.

```jsx
<Dropdown>
  <Dropdown.Trigger>
    <a>Link Trigger</a>
  </Dropdown.Trigger>
</Dropdown>
```
