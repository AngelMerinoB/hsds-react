# Container

A Grid.Container component provides container layout-based styles to help structure UI elements. Grid's styles are based on [`seed-grid`](http://developer.helpscout.net/seed/packs/seed-grid/).


## Example

```jsx
<Grid.Container>
  <Grid.Row>
    <Grid.Col>...</Grid.Col>
    <Grid.Col>...</Grid.Col>
    <Grid.Col>...</Grid.Col>
  </Grid.Row>
</Grid.Container>
```


## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| className | `string` | Custom class names to be added to the component. |
| fluid | `bool` | Adds fluid styles to the component. |
| responsive | `bool` | Adds responsive styles to the component. |
