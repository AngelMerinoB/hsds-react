# Row

A Grid.Row component provides row layout-based styles to help structure UI elements. Grid's styles are based on [`seed-grid`](http://developer.helpscout.net/seed/packs/seed-grid/).


## Example

```jsx
<Grid.Row>
  <Grid.Col>...</Grid.Col>
  <Grid.Col>...</Grid.Col>
  <Grid.Col>...</Grid.Col>
</Grid.Row>
```


## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| className | `string` | Custom class names to be added to the component. |
| flex | `bool` | Adds flex styles to the component. |
| size | `string` | Adds sizing styles to the component. |
